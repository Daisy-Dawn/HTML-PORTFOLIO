<h1>THE BEST SERIES EVER CREATED!!ðŸ¤©ðŸ˜Ž</h1>
<p>Author: Daisy Dawn</p>
<h2>My top 3 Series of all time!!</h2>
<hr />
<p>
    <h2>PRISON BREAK:</h2>
    <p>This is my favourite thriller, It has amazing everything, 
        both the plots, and the nudity is limited
    </p>
    <h2>VIKINGS:</h2>
    <p>It is all everything, talks about bravery. Honour, fighting who the people we love
        and most of all, power
    </p>
    <h2>GAME OF THRONES:</h2>
    <P>
        It is lesson packed, each episode full of morals to learn. Talks about being wise
        The strongest doesnt survive the most battles, the wisest does. Trust should only be
        to yourself. Not everything is as it seems and be careful of the people you trust and 
        call your friend

Thank you!<br />
